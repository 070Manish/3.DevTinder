Day 3

- Multiple Route Handler - Play with the code
- next()
- next function and error along with res.send()
- app.use("/route", [rh1, rh2, rh3], rh4, rh5); route handler array.
- What is a Middleware ? why do we need it?
- How express JS basically handles requests behind the scenes.
- Difference between app.use and app.all
- Write a dummy auth Middleware for admin
- Write a dummy auth Middleware for all user routes, except /user/login
- Error handling using app.use("/", (err, req, res, next))
- use Try and catch
